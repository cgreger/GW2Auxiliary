### Note for 2-8-17
I had issues configuring my test database to be the same before each run of the test class. 
I found out that I was missing an auto generate annotation on my id.
I also ran into issues with annotations on my auto generated timestamp.

I definitely learned how important it is to have the right annotations for each field!

In the future, when my database is not functioning correctly and when I am so sure that it should be working,
I am going to check my class annotations first!
